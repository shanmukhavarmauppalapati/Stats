point estimation
statistics

point estimation, in statistics :

the process of finding an approximate value of some parameter—such as the mean (average)—of a population from random samples of the population.

What is the Purpose of Point Estimation? What is a Point Estimator?

Basically point estimators are known to be functions that are used to find an approximate or an estimated value of a population parameter from various random samples of the population.

What is Point Estimation and Interval Estimation?

A point estimate can be defined as a single value estimate of a parameter. For instance, a sample mean is also known to be a point estimate of a population mean.

An interval estimate generally gives you a range of values where the parameter is expected to lie and a confidence interval is the most common type of interval estimate. 


Random Sample and Statistic

Random Sample: A set of IID(Independent and Identically distributed) random variables, X1, X2, X3, ——–, Xn defined on the same sample space is called a random sample of size n.

Statistic: A function of a random sample is called a statistic
